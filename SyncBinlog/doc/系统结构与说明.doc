Should I use retry or acks_late?
Answer: Depends. It’s not necessarily one or the other, you may want to use both.
Task.retry?is used to retry tasks, notably for expected errors that is catchable with thetry:?block. The AMQP transaction is not used for these errors:?if the task raises an exception it is still acknowledged!
